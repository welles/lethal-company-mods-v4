# InsanityMod

A Lethal Company mod that tracks player sanity and makes high-insanity runs genuinely terrifying.

**Game version:** V80–81 | **BepInEx:** 5.4.23.5+

## Dependencies

- [WeatherRegistry](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/WeatherRegistry/) — required for Paranoia weather

## What it does

### Insanity meter

Insanity (0–100%) accumulates while you're inside the facility and drains while you're outdoors during the day. The ship is a partial refuge — it drains insanity while the lights are on, and creeps it up slowly when they're off.

- **Solo in the facility:** ~10 minutes to 100%
- **On the ship:** slowly drains with lights on (−0.3/s), creeps up slowly when dark (+0.15/s)
- **Outdoors (daytime):** slowly decays back toward 0
- **Outdoors (night / Eclipse):** insanity rises instead of falling
- **On the Company moon (Gordion):** drains regardless of lights — the Company is a thematic refuge
- **Resets each round** — every new expedition starts fresh

### Things that make it worse

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Visible enemy nearby | +rate per second (scales by enemy type) |
| Watching a teammate die | instant spike |
| Paranoia weather | rate multiplier |
| Night outdoors | slow rise instead of decay |
| Eclipse weather outdoors | faster rise than night |
| Underwater | +0.4/s |
| Ship with lights off | +0.15/s (mild creep) |

Enemy threat scale (examples): Bracken / Ghost Girl = 2.0×, Jester / Coilhead = 1.5×, Forest Giant / Masked = 1.4×, Sand Worm = 1.8×, Thumper = 0.8×

### Things that make it better

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Teammate within 6m | −0.15/s |
| Flashlight on / in ship | −0.1/s |
| Near a facility light | −0.1/s |
| Ship with lights on | −0.3/s (base rate) |
| TZP-Inhalant effect active | −1.0/s |
| On the Company moon (Gordion) | −0.5/s |

Being with a teammate near a light source in the facility effectively keeps insanity stable — unless the apparatus has been removed. TZP-Inhalant is a strong safety valve: one inhale (~17 s effect window) recovers ~17%. Note: TZP does **not** reduce insanity inside the facility after the apparatus has been removed (the apparatus-removed penalty disables all in-facility recovery).

## Effects at high insanity

Things start happening as insanity climbs. Find out for yourself.

<details>
<summary>Spoilers — click to reveal</summary>

### 70% — Voice distortion
Nearby teammates' voices begin to sound subtly warped. The mod also captures a rolling 30-second buffer of teammate voice chat and starts playing back distorted snippets spatially in 3D — you'll hear phantom voices from positions that seem to move.

### 80% — Tunnel vision
A deep red vignette slowly pulses in from the edges of the screen. The pulse and color intensity increase toward 100%.

Also at 80%+: the Ghost Girl (DressGirl) slightly increases her haunt speed while targeting you.

### 90% — Camera shake
Perlin-noise position and rotation jitter on the camera. Starts subtle, gets pronounced at 100%.

### 100% — Transformation
Insanity peaks. Movement gradually slows to a halt, the screen fades to black, and a Masked enemy spawns at your position wearing your suit. You die.

The transformation can be disabled in config (`EnableMaskedTransform = false`).

### Apparatus removal
Pulling the apparatus triggers an immediate insanity spike for everyone in the round. For the rest of the round, insanity-reduction buffs (teammate proximity, flashlight, facility lights) no longer work inside the facility — insanity can only rise in there. Outdoors is unaffected.

## Paranoia weather

A custom weather event. During Paranoia, insanity accumulates faster in the facility and enemies are more active. Appears at roughly 3% chance per night (configurable).

---

## HUD

A small ring meter in the bottom-right corner of the screen shows your current insanity percentage. Color shifts white → yellow → red as it fills.

---

## End-of-round results

After the ship leaves, the host broadcasts each player's peak insanity for the round to all clients.

---

## Configuration

All values are in `BepInEx/config/com.insanitymod.lethalcompany.cfg`.
