# Universal Radar

### My solution to the problems with the vanilla radar and the incompatibilities it introduces with modded moons, all in one highly configurable package!

---

- **Automatically detects terrain meshes on any moon and generates a contour map**
	- This works for modded moons via LLL (assuming it can find something that looks like terrain), and supports both mesh terrain or Unity's built-in terrain.
	- These are also highly configurable, so if you aren't happy with how a certain moon's map is auto-generated, you can always adjust its parameters.

- **Generates radar objects for large meshes (and bodies of water) on modded moons**
	- So you can usually see buildings and other large obstacles on the radar as well

- **New handcrafted radar sprites for objects, buildings, and hazards on vanilla moons**

- **Automatically reverts to a basic version of the pre-v70 radar if a player is inside an interior that doesn't have any radar map sprites**

- **A few other tweaks to radar and camera things to make the rest of the mod work as intended**

## Questions / Issues

### What does this do for modded moons and vanilla moons?

On modded moons, this will add a height-shaded terrain contour map (if applicable terrain can be found) and create translucent meshes for large objects which will appear on the radar screen. This should be enough to create a fully functioning radar even when the moon creator hasn't added a contour map or any radar sprites themselves.

On vanilla moons, a terrain contour map is still generated automatically, but instead of meshes generated at runtime, sprites are used to represent buildings and large objects (which is more in-line with the vanilla style).

All of this is configurable, though, so if you want one feature but not the other, or vanilla moons to use generated meshes instead, that's all possible.

### What about moons without terrain?

Even without the terrain contour map, the generated radar meshes for large objects should usually fill in more boxy or industrial environments.

### Does this do anything for modded interiors?

Yes (kind of)! Doing fully dynamic runtime generated interior radar isn't an easy undertaking, and the structure I use for outside contour map generation isn't super easy to apply to interiors yet.

So, until I or somebody else gets around to actually finishing a project like that, Universal Radar will automatically restore something similar to the old radar when a player is inside an interior detected to have no radar sprites. This should at least make outdated interiors playable, if a little visually jarring.

### How does this affect load times or performance?

It certainly may add a bit to your load times, but it should only be really significant when landing on a moon that does not have mesh terrain (the standard vanilla type of terrain in Lethal Company) for the first time. This can take especially long depending on the size or number of terrain objects on the moon. However, meshes are remembered for the rest of the session after this.

*(if this becomes a serious problem or even times out players with load times, you can disable these types of maps from being generated in config)*

The one other area I'd be concerned about for performance (though I haven't tested this extensively) is the generation of radar objects. So, if you feel like this mod is lowering your FPS (especially when looking at the radar screen), try lowering the ``Radar Object Display Threshold`` in config, or use the master disable option to stop generating them entirely.

I also have some built-in debug logs for timing certain methods, so if you're interested in those sorts of details you can take a look.

### The default generated maps for certain moons don't look right

Consult the user guide below if you want to better configure it, and if it's your moon, consult the moon creator guide for how you can improve compatibility/change those default config settings.

### What moons don't work with Universal Radar?

As far as I know, [Magic Wesley's Cosmocos](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Magic_Wesley/Cosmocos/) is the only entirely incompatible moon, but some may have mixed results, especially if they have many dynamic elements. Let me know if there are any other completely dysfunctional moons.

### Why is this a dependency of [RebalancedMoons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/dopadream/RebalancedMoonsBeta/)?

In short: To create nice looking contour maps for its customized versions of the vanilla moons automatically.

The way RebalancedMoons works is it totally replaces the vanilla levels with its own, so the only options are to have its own custom contour maps for every moon, or use Universal Radar as an automatic solution. RebalancedMoons also utilizes the same sprites as Universal Radar, so the radar for its altered moons will have the same style as vanilla moons do when using Universal Radar.

Also: the sprites on RebalancedMoons are still affected by the radar sprite colour config in Universal Radar.

### Is this compatible with [MapImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SpookyBuddy/MapImprovements/)?

Only contour maps will display for vanilla moons, with no sprites or automatically generated radar objects.

MapImprovements does its additions after my mod in the load order, so even dynamically generated meshes would be inaccurate, therefore no radar objects will be shown at all on vanilla moons with MapImprovements installed.

Terrain contour maps should work fine as far as I know. It's a difficult problem to solve since I'd likely need to totally change when my mod runs, which presents some challenges.

### Does this work client-side?

Maybe? Theoretically everything it does is on the client, but it would naturally mean some players would take longer loading than others. Let me know if you try it.

### Some objects aren't appearing on the radar on modded moons

If the object is smaller (specifically it's bounding box, something diagonal will be "bigger" than the same thing horizontal), then you can try lowering the `Radar Object Display Threshold` in general config.

However, there are other reasons why objects may not appear, such as the components they have and the structure of their colliders and renderers. This is just down to the way the moon is made, but I hope to be able to further improve my algorithm to better detect these anomalies.

### What about things on a moon that move or appear sometime after it loads?

Since Universal Radar does its generation right after the level loads, it goes before most other things (including random spawned map objects and any mods/moon mechanics which might introduce objects into the scene). I might want to change this at some point to improve compatibility, but at the moment I don't want to risk breaking all my existing code for it.

Some moving things might have the radar meshes move with them depending on how they're structured, but don't count on it 100%.

### The contour lines sometimes have messy pointy bits and smudges or other artifacts

The lines themselves will sometimes be sharp because they're based on a mesh which can have sharp edges and jagged turns, but there are also some underlying issues with the shader used to generate these contour maps (especially noticeable with larger line thickness). I worked on this issue for a while, but was unable to come up with anything better than what I have now. I very much hope there is some way to further improve the shader to reduce these issues, but it might require switching to a different method of generating contours entirely.

### Configuration modes

After generating the config by starting/joining a lobby, each moon will have an entry in config (under `Moon Overrides`). Most of these will be set to `Auto`, which means the shading of the map will be calculated based on the mesh when the moon loads.

If you change the mode to `Manual`, then re-generate your config again, you'll have many more options to customize that moon more precisely.

If you want to not generate a contour map at all on a moon, change the mode to `Ignore`.

Those three modes just relate to the contour map. There are two options for the generated radar objects on each moon that are always there regardless of mode (though setting a moon to `Ignore` will disable `Show Radar Objects` after next launch, you can just re-enable them if you want).

### Quick and easy moon changes

There are a few immediate options for tweaking contour maps for specific moons in `Moon Overrides`.

Options for radar objects (all modes):

- **Show Radar Objects:** Generates meshes for large objects on the moon and display them on the radar screen (will usually make things like large obstacles, buildings, or foliage visible).

- **More Translucent Radar Objects** For moons with very dense sets of objects (often when a moon has a large interior section), the radar meshes will be more transparent and thus won't be as overly bright when many are layered on top of each other.

Options in `Auto` mode:

- **Broader Height Range**: This is the first thing to try toggling if the shading on a moon appears to get too bright too quickly. It will spread out the shading over a longer stretch of elevations.

- **Opacity Multiplier**: Increase or decrease this to multiply the overall opacity level of the map's shading (higher values make the shading lighter). Note that since this is multiplication, if the shading is already almost black, multiplying it won't do much since it's already so low.

In `Automatic Settings` there are some global settings for how all moons (with mode set to `Auto`) will automatically generate their contour maps:

- **Line Spacing**: The vertical height that will separate each contour line (lower this to add more lines, increase it to make fewer lines).

- **Line Thickness**: How thick the contour lines should be (**be aware that setting this higher will make errors in contour lines much more noticeable, and also will have less and less impact on thickness with larger values**).

- **Max Opacity**: How light the very highest parts of a contour map should be (higher for lighter).

`Broader Height Range` is usually the quickest fix for moons which are overly bright/change gradient too quickly, but `Opacity Multiplier` and the global setting `Max Opacity` can also be useful for troubleshooting.

Note that the `Max Opacity` will only stop the shading from getting any brighter, but if you multiply the shading enough, it might reach that maximum before the actual target height for the map. If you're setting the maximum opacity to something below 0.9, you might want to try setting the `Opacity Multiplier` to the same thing, which should keep the multiplier from getting too ahead of the maximum.

### Colour configuration

If you want to really customize radar appearance, you can find colour configuration for all the moons under	`Moon Overrides (Colour)`.

All moons will have the following options:

- **Shading Colour**: Colour of the fill between contour lines which shows elevation.

- **Line Colour**: Colour of the contour lines themselves.

- **Object Colour**: Colour of any automatically generated radar objects (by default these only generate on modded moons).

- **Background Colour**: Colour of the radar screen's background (by default this is a very very dark green).

Vanilla moons will also have an option for the colour of their radar sprites (which are used by vanilla moons instead of the automatically generated radar objects):

- **Sprite Colour**: Colour of the 2D sprites used for the radar on vanilla moons

Some additional colour-related config can be found under `Vanilla Radar Sprites`:

- **Match Ship Sprite Colour To Radar**: The sprite of your ship will change from green to whatever the colour of the radar sprites/radar objects is on the current moon (this is on by default, so the ship doesn't look so out of place).

- **Ship Sprite Colour**: If you disable the above option, you can use this instead to customize the ship's sprite colour on all moons

### Full manual customization

If you switch to the `Manual` mode in `Moon Overrides` (then join a game to generate the config), you can change all values for that moon individually, including: `Opacity Multiplier`, `Line Spacing`, `Line Thickness`, and `Max Opacity`.

Most importantly, it also makes the minimum and maximum height for the shading configurable (in `Auto` mode, these are automatically computed based on the terrain mesh):

- **Minimum and Maximum Shading Height**: The heights where shading starts and ends (from black at the minimum to fully light at the maximum).

Since they're usually found automatically, it can be a tricky process trying to change them yourself (note that the default values are just filler ones used for every moon, so changing a moon to manual will probably look bad if you don't set these yourself). You'll probably want a reference for where they're usually calculated at, so try enabling the `Log Automatic Values` setting in `Automatic Settings` and land on the moon you're interested in customizing (in `Auto` mode). Check the logs for the maximum and minimum values it generates, and use those as a starting point.

### Additional config

There are also a handful of general configs for what types of radar objects should show up and more fine-tuning, but they're mostly self-explanatory. So, just give the config a read over if you want to change something.

### Existing contour maps

By default, Universal Radar will disable any existing contour maps when it introduces its own. Moons can be set to `Ignore` in config to leave all their assets untouched. If you want the default values changed, see that section down below.

### Contour map compatibility

If you want to ensure your moon's terrain will be selected and used adequately, here's some tips:

- **If possible, use [TerraMesh](https://github.com/v0xx-dev/TerraMesh) to convert your terrain to a mesh if you haven't already (you can find more info in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1303914349533990983)), as this will significantly reduce load times when first landing on the moon with this mod (and is probably a good idea regardless to make terrain look nice).**

- Make sure your intended terrain objects have "terrain" in their name (and are either a Unity terrain object or have a mesh collider), and if there's any terrain you don't want to be mapped, make sure either the object or one of its parents has "OutOfBounds" somewhere in its name (neither of these are case sensitive).

	- *I automatically detect terrain based on a bunch of factors, so it can work without doing this, but you might as well guarantee it.*

- Clean up your nav mesh so it isn't going excessively out of bounds. I use the nav mesh to refine down the height range for terrains, so if the nav mesh is going way too high up the height shading will be off, and if it goes too far out a lot of out of bounds terrains or objects might have meshes generated for them (it's also probably a good idea to do this in general).

- Make sure your terrain is on the `Room` layer (which it already should be).

- Certain components can cause problems when cloned, such as animators, network objects, and skinned mesh renderers. So if your terrain object has any of those attached it will be skipped over 
	
	- *If you absolutely need those components on your terrain, you can always use some box colliders or other objects that do show up on the radar to fill in the gaps.*

### Radar object compatibility

If you're having issues with non-terrain objects not showing up on your moon, here are some things to note:

- I check for objects of a certain size (based on the size threshold in config) on the `Room`, `Default`, and `Collider` layers (plus `Foliage` and `Terrain` if a specific config is enabled), so make sure you're objects aren't really small and are on the right layers.

	- *Specifically, it looks at the area of the bounding box of the object when seen from above.*

- Meshes are found based on colliders, so your mesh renderers shouldn't be too far from your colliders in the hierarchy. Specifically, the mesh renderer should be either a parent, a grandparent, or on the same object as the collider (if this is too inconvenient, you can just give the colliders mesh renderers and they'll act as an outline for the missing mesh).

- Certain key words are used to include certain meshes regardless of their size: "catwalk" (anywhere in the object's path), "bridge" (anywhere in the object's path), or "floor" (specifically in the name of the mesh renderer), all not case-sensitive.

- Like with terrain, "outofbounds" in the path of an object will also exclude it from being used.

- I avoid certain components on objects, such as animators, network objects, and skinned mesh renderers, so note that mesh renderers associated with those won't be used.

	- *If you really need a radar object to move with an animation, try making it a child object without an actual animator, that should work fine.*

- For water, I just look for materials with names containing "water" and a shader name also containing "water". As far as I know this works for both vanilla and modded water blocks.

### Changing default values

If contour maps or radar objects aren't generating nicely with default `Auto` settings, I have some LLL content tags in place to make some adjustments. Simply make a content tag and set the "Content Tag Name" to one of the following and add it to your extended level to change the default config values:

- **`UniversalRadarExtendHeight`**: Equivalent to the `Broden Height Range` config, will increase the maximum level for shading. This is a common fix for contour shading being too bright or transitioning too quickly.

- **`UniversalRadarHideObjects`**: Equivalent to (disabling) the `Show Radar Objects` config, use this if you want radar object meshes to not generate on your moon by default.

- **`UniversalRadarLowOpacityObjects`**: Equivalent to the `More Translucent Radar Objects` config, use this if you have lots of layered radar objects that make things look way too bright.

- **`UniversalRadarIgnore`**: Equivalent to setting the mode of a moon to `Ignore`. This will mean Universal Radar won't change this moon at all by default.

- **`UniversalRadarBaseColor`**: Determines the colour of the contour shading on your moon. Set this using the "Content Tag Color" field.

- **`UniversalRadarLineColor`**: Determines the colour of the contour lines on your moon. Set this using the "Content Tag Color" field.

- **`UniversalRadarObjectColor`**: Determines the colour of any radar objects which generate on your moon. Set this using the "Content Tag Color" field.

- **`UniversalRadarBackgroundColor`**: Determines the colour of the radar screen's background on your moon (usually it's black with a very slight tint of green). Set this using the "Content Tag Color" field.

Most of these still keep the moon in `Auto` mode, though. So, if you really need more fine control, you can either ask me to change the default values for you or patch the return value of [this method](https://github.com/Science-Bird/UniversalRadar/blob/main/Patches/LLLConfigPatch.cs#L48) in my mod yourself.

### Making radar sprites

Specifically for vanilla moons, I've made a bunch of custom radar sprites to populate the radar while still maintaining the original feel. If you want to try using these for your own moon, all the sprite assets/colours I used are publicly available [here](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1385016182330888252/1385710334127640707). Just ask me if you need any tips or want to know how I made certain sprites.
